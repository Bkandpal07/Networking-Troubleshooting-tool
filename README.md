# Networking-Troubleshooting-tool

My project is a Networking Troubleshooting Tool designed to simplify common network diagnostic tasks. It’s a user-friendly application with a graphical interface that helps users perform tasks like checking network connectivity, analyzing routes, scanning open ports, calculating subnet details, and converting domain names to IP addresses.

This tool integrates multiple networking utilities into one application, making it easier for users to identify and solve network issues without needing to type commands manually. For example, you can check if a server is reachable using the ping test, analyze the path data takes through the network using traceroute, or determine which ports are open on a system.

The project is built using Python, leveraging libraries like socket, os, and tkinter for functionality and interface. It also uses threading to improve the speed of tasks like port scanning. All results are logged in a file for future reference.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for network administrators and users to troubleshoot network issues efficiently. It’s especially helpful for those who may not be familiar with complex networking commands but need to diagnose problems quickly."
